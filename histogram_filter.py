        Takes in a prior belief distribution, a colormap, action, and observation, and returns the posterior
        belief distribution according to the Bayes Filter.
        :param cmap: The binary NxM colormap known to the robot.
        :param belief: An NxM numpy ndarray representing the prior belief.
        :param action: The action as a numpy ndarray. [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        :param observation: The observation from the color sensor. [0 or 1].
        :return: The posterior distribution.
        Use starter.npz data given in /data to debug and test your code. starter.npz has sequence of actions and 
        corresponding observations. True belief is also given to compare your filters results with actual results. 
        cmap = arr_0, actions = arr_1, observations = arr_2, true state = arr_3
